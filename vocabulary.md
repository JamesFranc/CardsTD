<br></br>
__Field:__ This is your board, the front yard of your gingerbread house. All monsters/defenses interact here, and the card text will refer to your “field.” Your field is composed of 4 lanes and 5 numbered rows, for a total of 20 tiles.
<br>
__Lane:__ The vertical columns on your field. There are 4 lanes on your field.
<br>
__Row:__ The numbered horizontal tiles on your field. There are 5 rows on your field.
<br>
__Tile:__ One square on your field.
<br>
__Resurrection:__ These monsters never die, but instead,
when you successfully destroy them in combat, you may place them anywhere in row 5 on an opponent’s field. They will force monsters to move forward if you place them in a spot occupied by a monster. They can be placed in any lane, regardless of the card’s lane indicator.
<br>
__Combat:__ Any time a monster runs into a defense card, or any time a defense card uses an activated ability against another defense or monster card, combat happens. The result of combat
will always result in one or both cards being destroyed.
<br>
__Flip:__ Instructs you to turn over an action or monster card and play them normally.
<br>
__Destroy:__ When a card is destroyed, it is removed from the field and placed in a discard pile next to the deck it came from.
<br>
__Once per turn:__ There are several defense cards that have an ability you can use once per turn. This is only allowed on YOUR turn. You may not use these abilities on other players’ turns. Most of these abilities deal damage to monsters/defenses. If a monster or defense is dealt damage equal to its power, it is destroyed.
<br>
__Enters the game:__ There are several monsters with this text, do what the card says immediately. Their ability only happens the very first time they enter the game. If these monsters switch fields, their ability does not happen again.
<br>
__Swap:__ When this keyword is used, the respective row or lane is identically swapped. This means that every card must be placed the exact same way on the new field as it was on the previous field.
