# CardsTD
A tower defense game played with cards

This will start off as a browser-based tower defense game played with cards.

#Initial plan
First make a hot-seat version of the game 
Then work on internet/client hosted games

#Introduction
CardsTD is based on the board game Gingerdead House. There is no intention of monetary gain, just the desire to play the game in an online setting. This is loosely based, and the rules and aspects of the game are likely to change as the project progresses and evolves. The kickstarter link below shows the original game and from there, you can download a pdf of the original rule set.
