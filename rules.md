 <h2>Setting Up the Game</h2>
Each player gets a board of their own. Draw from your deck until you reveal 3 defense cards. You may place these on the field in any tile that you see fit. Put all extras back into your deck, shuffle, and then draw your hand of 5 cards. Any cards that get used or destroyed during play go to a discard pile next to its respective deck.
 
 <h2>Order of Play (Phases)</h2>
 __1. Action:__ Flip the top action card. This card tells you how many monsters are drawn and placed on the field, as well as any
additional shenanigans that may occur. If there are no more monsters to be flipped, shuffle its discard pile and start fresh.
 
 <br>
 __2. Monster:__ Flip monster cards equal to the number listed on the action card. All monsters enter the field in row 5. If you draw multiple monsters with the same lane indicator, they force each other to move down the field. Each monster has a lane indicator located at the bottom of the card indicating which lane they enter the game. Some monsters have various effects. Pay close attention to the card’s text as it can greatly affect the outcome of play.

 <br>
 __3. Player:__ You will have a mix of defense cards and trick cards in your hand. Feel free to play your whole hand, or save some for later on in the game. You may place your defense cards in any empty space on your field, and play tricks as you see fit. Defense cards can replace other defenses, but the defense card that was replaced will be destroyed and moved to your discard pile. Any cards that say ONCE PER TURN may be played in this step. Any defense cards that are able to move do so
in this step. Feel free to cause pain and suffering. If an action card says that opponents may play trick cards, they get to do so during this step before you play your defenses or tricks.
 
 <br>
 __4. Movement & Combat:__ Monsters move down one row, lane by lane, left to right. EXAMPLE: A monster is going to run into the defense “Maltball Mines”. The order of the monster movement would be relevant to what cards would be destroyed. Combat happens when a monster comes in contact with a defense card. Combat happens immediately, and the higher power always wins. Ties result in both being destroyed. If the monster destroys your defense, the monster then occupies the destroyed defense’s space. If the defense card wins, the monster is destroyed and the rest of the monsters move forward normally. Damage is not cumulative. If 2 monsters fight the same defense card, the damage from the first monster does not “stack” with the second monster. Additionally, if 2 defenses attack the same monster, this damage does not stack. Combat is always the power of the monster versus the power of the defense card for each combat. If a monster gets past row 1, game over man, game over!

 <br>
 __5. Cleanup & Draw:__ If you survive the advancement of the witch’s minions you may draw cards to replenish your hand up to 5. When you run out of cards in your deck, shuffle your discard pile and start fresh.

 <h2>Winning Conditions</h2>
 If your gingerbread house is the last standing, congratulations you won! This means that every other player had a monster pass their row 1, and were defeated by the witch’s horde. Now it’s time to round up the Gummy Bear Army and find the sinister Rumpe L. Stiltskin.
